This Python script builds a machine learning model to predict age groups ('Adult' or 'Senior'). It loads and preprocesses data (encoding the target, selecting features, and filling missing values), then trains a RandomForestClassifier. Finally, it generates predictions on new data and saves them to a submission file.
